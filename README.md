# 🌦 Weather Modeling Using Quadratic Equation  

This project demonstrates *weather prediction* using a simple *quadratic equation* and shows how the same system can be developed under different *software engineering models*:  

- 🏗 *Waterfall Model*  
- 🔄 *Iterative Model*  
- ⚡ *Agile Model (Scrum)*  

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict *temperature* throughout the day using:


- Simulate the *software development lifecycle (SDLC)* in 3 approaches  
- Compare predictions using *actual vs hypothetical data*  

---

## 📌 Features
- Hourly temperature forecast  
- Daily summary (avg. temp, rainfall, humidity)  
- Graphical visualization (Matplotlib)  
- Weather alerts for extreme conditions  
- Demonstrates *Waterfall, Iterative, Agile* workflows  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- *Language:* Python  
- *Libraries:* NumPy, Matplotlib  

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
